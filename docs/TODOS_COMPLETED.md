## Test Tomorrow Morning

### ✅ Working
- Homepage loads
- Admin pages load
- Build compiles successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- No linting errors

### ⚠️ Needs Testing
1. **Search Functionality**
   - Currently returning "Search failed" on Vercel
   - Elasticsearch health check shows "unhealthy"
   - **Action**: Verify Elasticsearch credentials in Vercel environment variables
   - Local search should work fine

2. **Upstash Redis** (Optional)
   - Cache is disabled (no credentials set)
   - **Action**: Add `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to Vercel if caching desired

### Quick Morning Checklist
1. ✅ Check Vercel deployment URL
2. 🔄 Test search locally: `npm run dev`
3. 🔄 Verify Elasticsearch credentials in Vercel dashboard
4. 🔄 Test admin curations UI
5. 🔄 Test admin boosting UI
6. 🔄 Try autocomplete suggestions
7. 🔄 Test state auto-detection with "texas health plans"
