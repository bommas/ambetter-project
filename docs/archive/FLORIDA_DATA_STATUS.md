python3 run_multi_state_pipeline.py
```

**What it will do**:

- ✅ Index plan descriptions, benefits, programs
- ✅ Make searchable immediately
- ⏱️ Quick (no PDF processing needed)

**Result**: Users can search for Florida plans and get general information

### Option 2: Find and Add PDF Brochures (More Complete)

**Manual Steps**:
1. Visit https://www.ambetterhealth.com/en/fl/
2. Look for "Brochures", "Forms", "Documents" links
3. Update config with the correct URL

**If you find a brochures page**:
```javascript
// Update config/app-config.js
florida: {
  brochuresUrl: 'https://www.ambetterhealth.com/en/fl/2025-brochures/', // Add this
  healthPlansUrl: 'https://www.ambetterhealth.com/en/fl/health-plans/',
  state: 'FL',
  extractPDFs: true,
  crawlContent: true
}
```

Then run: `python3 run_multi_state_pipeline.py`

---

## 📝 Configuration Status

### Current Config (`config/app-config.js`):

```javascript
florida: {
  healthPlansUrl: 'https://www.ambetterhealth.com/en/fl/health-plans/',
  state: 'FL',
  extractPDFs: true,  // Will try to find PDFs
  crawlContent: true  // Will crawl web content
}
```

**What happens when you run the pipeline**:
1. ✅ Will crawl the health plans page and extract all text
2. ⚠️ Will not find PDFs (none exist on that page)
3. ✅ Will still index useful content for searching
