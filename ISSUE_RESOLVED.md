# Internal Server Error - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue
User reported "internal server error" on local machine when accessing search pages.

## Root Cause
Next.js build cache corruption causing webpack module resolution errors:
```
Error: Cannot find module './638.js'
```

This occurred after multiple hot-reloads and code changes, causing stale webpack chunks in the `.next` directory.

## Solution
1. Stopped the development server
2. Cleaned the `.next` build cache directory
3. Restarted the dev server

```bash
# Kill dev server
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Clean build cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart
npm run dev
```

## Verification
- ✅ Search API now returns results (910 documents for "preventive care")
- ✅ Homepage loads successfully
- ✅ Search results page renders correctly
- ✅ All APIs functioning normally

## Prevention
When experiencing webpack/module errors in development:
1. Always try cleaning `.next` directory first
2. Restart dev server cleanly
3. If issues persist, run `npm run build` to test production build

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Local development environment fully operational
